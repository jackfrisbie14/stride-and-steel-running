## Script 1 — "The Wrong Way" (Problem/Agitation)

**Angle:** You've been training wrong and wasting time
**Duration:** 35 seconds
**Hook style:** Controversial statement to stop the scroll

### Script

**[0:00–0:03] HOOK (UGC talking head)**
"I wasted six months training for a half marathon — and I didn't even know it."

**[0:03–0:06] PROBLEM (UGC talking head)**
"I was running five days a week, doing random YouTube lifting workouts on the side, and wondering why I was always tired, always sore, and getting slower."

**[0:06–0:10] AGITATE (UGC talking head)**
"Turns out, training without a real program is like driving without directions. You're moving, but you're not getting anywhere."

**[0:10–0:15] DISCOVERY (UGC talking head + B-roll transition)**
"Then I found this app called Stride & Steel. You take a sixty-second quiz..."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip A: Quiz flow, 3 seconds]

**[0:15–0:20] REVEAL (B-roll)**
"...and it builds you a full hybrid training plan — running AND lifting — based on your actual goals."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip B: Results reveal, 3 seconds]
> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip C: Dashboard overview, 2 seconds]

**[0:20–0:27] VALUE (UGC talking head)**
"A running coach costs two hundred to four hundred a month. A personal trainer is sixty to a hundred bucks a session. This gives you both for fifty bucks a month."

**[0:27–0:32] CTA (UGC talking head)**
"And right now you can try it for ninety-nine cents. Seven days, full access, cancel anytime. Link's in my bio."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip G: Pricing page flash, 2 seconds]

**[0:32–0:35] END CARD**
Text overlay: "Stride & Steel — $0.99 trial" with logo

## Script 2 — "The Price Comparison" (Value)

**Angle:** What you're paying vs. what you could be paying
**Duration:** 40 seconds
**Hook style:** Direct-to-camera money talk

### Script

**[0:00–0:03] HOOK (UGC talking head)**
"Let me break down what personalized training actually costs."

**[0:03–0:08] COMPARISON (UGC talking head, use hand gestures for emphasis)**
"A personal running coach? Two hundred to four hundred dollars a month. A personal trainer twice a week? That's four hundred eighty to eight hundred a month. So if you want someone programming your running AND your lifting? You're looking at over a thousand a month."

**[0:08–0:12] PIVOT (UGC talking head)**
"Or... you could use what I use."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip C: Dashboard overview, 3 seconds]

**[0:12–0:20] PRODUCT DEMO (B-roll with voiceover)**
"Stride and Steel builds you a personalized hybrid training plan. Every week you get your runs programmed..."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip D: Expand a Run workout, 3 seconds]

"...your lifting sessions laid out with sets, reps, and weight tracking..."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip D: Expand a Lift workout, 2 seconds]
> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip F: Logging weights, 3 seconds]

**[0:20–0:27] PERSONALIZATION (B-roll with voiceover)**
"It even shows you exactly how to do every exercise with video demos and form tips, so you're not guessing in the gym."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip E: Exercise demo modal with GIF, 4 seconds]

**[0:27–0:33] PRICE DROP (UGC talking head)**
"All of that — both coaches, fully personalized — for forty-nine ninety-nine a month. That's less than a single personal training session."

**[0:33–0:38] CTA (UGC talking head)**
"And your first week is ninety-nine cents. I'm not kidding. Ninety-nine cents for seven days of full access. Link below."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip G: Pricing page, 2 seconds]

**[0:38–0:40] END CARD**
Text overlay: "$0.99 for 7 days → strideandsteel.com"

## Script 3 — "The Wake-Up Call" (Urgency/Transformation)

**Angle:** Every day without a plan is a wasted day
**Duration:** 35 seconds
**Hook style:** Relatable frustration

### Script

**[0:00–0:03] HOOK (UGC talking head)**
"Be honest — when's the last time you followed an actual training program?"

**[0:03–0:07] PAIN POINT (UGC talking head)**
"Not a random workout you found online. Not whatever you feel like doing that day. An actual program built for YOUR goals, YOUR schedule, YOUR experience level."

**[0:07–0:11] TWIST (UGC talking head)**
"I used to just wing it. Some running here, some lifting there. I was 'training' five days a week and had nothing to show for it."

**[0:11–0:17] SOLUTION (UGC talking head + B-roll transition)**
"Stride and Steel changed that. You take a quick quiz — sixty seconds — and it figures out your training archetype."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip A: Quiz flow, 2 seconds]
> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip B: Archetype reveal, 3 seconds]

**[0:17–0:24] DEMO (B-roll with voiceover)**
"Then it builds your entire week. Runs, lifts, recovery — all programmed together so they actually complement each other instead of competing."

> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip C: Dashboard with stat cards, 3 seconds]
> [SCREEN RECORD — Clip D: Expanded workout with exercises, 3 seconds]

**[0:24–0:28] TRANSFORMATION (UGC talking head)**
"Three weeks in, I was running faster AND hitting PRs in the gym. That doesn't happen by accident — that's programming."

**[0:28–0:33] CTA (UGC talking head)**
"Try it for ninety-nine cents. One week. If it doesn't change how you train, cancel — you're out less than a dollar."

**[0:33–0:35] END CARD**
Text overlay: "Your plan is waiting → strideandsteel.com"

## MakeUGC Setup Tips

1. **Avatar selection:** Pick a fitness-oriented avatar that matches your target demo (25–40, athletic but approachable — not a bodybuilder)
2. **Tone:** Conversational, like talking to a friend at the gym. Not salesy.
3. **Pacing:** Fast in the hook (first 3 seconds), slightly slower during the product demo, fast again at the CTA
4. **B-roll timing:** Upload your screen recordings as B-roll clips. In MakeUGC, place them at the timestamps marked above. The avatar audio continues as voiceover during B-roll.
5. **Captions:** Always on. 70%+ of Facebook video is watched with sound off.
6. **Aspect ratio:** 9:16 for Reels/Stories placements, 1:1 for feed. Render both.
7. **Thumbnail/first frame:** Use a text hook overlay on the first frame — the spoken hook as text, large and readable.
